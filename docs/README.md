# How to develop docs

Docs are automatically generated into emx2.jar file as well as to http://molgenis.github.com/molgenis-emx2/

You can serve docs locally to ease development as follows:

First time, install docsify

```aidl
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Then you can serve the dev in this directory using

```aidl
docsify serve
```

And view the result on

```aidl
http://localhost:3000
```
